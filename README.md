- 👋 Hi, I’m Virgil, aka @TheRubyJailCell, and I'm a 21yo Student @ Gobelins, l'Ecole de l'Image in Paris. I'm currently studying for a Video Game Artist Bachelor's degree there :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Video Games production, mostly the Art department, but I can code as well! My preferred domains are 2D and Concept Art, along with Character Design, though 3D and developping always have been facinating to me too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and C++ on my own! While I do have a certain background on Unity, I've barely started Unreal Engine as of now, and thus would like to extend my knowledge of the software.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Game related, honestly! Looking for professional experiences in the field.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, you can find me on near all social medias under the name TheRubyJailCell, but you should definitely look at <a href="https://therubyjailcell.github.io/">my (albeit small) website</a>, or <a href="https://therubyjailcell.artstation.com/">my portfolio on ArtStation</a>!
